# PTP master slave with Raspberrypi

This document describes results in timing synchronization performance on a
setup with two Raspberrypis, one setup as a PTP master clock (Statum-1 NTP
clock) while the other acts as a PTP slave to sync its time. Data were
collected from the ptp4l slave algorithm internal metrics and log files and
therefore graphed.
